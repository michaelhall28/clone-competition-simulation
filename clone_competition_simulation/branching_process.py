"""
A class for running a branching process of clone growth.
This is based on the single progenitor model (Clayton et al 2007).

For easier comparison with the Moran and Wrightâ€“Fisher models, the differentiated cells in the basal layer are not
simulated. A class including those cells is available in general_differentiated_cell_class.py (accessed by defining r
and gamma when setting up the Parameters).

    A simplified version of the single progenitor model
    Progenitor cells either divide to form two new progenitor cells or they die
    The chance of division/death is determined by the fitness of the clone
    Cell fitness does not alter the cell turnover rate.
    The maximum fitness is 2. This results in no cell death and a cell division at every step, so all fitness values
    above 2 cannot increase the division probability any further.

    Unlike the Wright-Fisher or Moran models, the total population size is not fixed.
    Each cell acts independently of all other cells.

    Clones are simulated one at a time from the start to the end of the simulation time.
    This means you cannot stop the simulation early and get the full results up to a particular time point, it will be
    partial results (possibly up to the end of the simulation time) for some proportion of the cell population.
